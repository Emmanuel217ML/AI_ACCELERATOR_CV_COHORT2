    "## What is AI?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining AI — A Multi-Dimensional Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "AI can be defined along two primary dimensions: thinking vs. acting and human-like vs. ideal (rational) \n",
    "behavior. These give rise to four categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "## ● Thinking Humanly: Mimicking human cognitive processes.\n",
    "## ● Thinking Rationally: Emulating correct, logical reasoning.\n",
    "## ● Acting Humanly: Imitating human behavior in observable actions.\n",
    "## ● Acting Rationally: Making optimal decisions based on knowledge and expected outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each perspective offers unique insights and has shaped different subfields and methodologies within AI \n",
    "research.\n",
    "## Acting Humanly — The Turing Test Approach\n",
    "Proposed by Alan Turing in 1950, the Turing Test evaluates whether a computer can mimic human \n",
    "responses so convincingly that a human interrogator cannot distinguish it from a person. To pass the \n",
    "Turing Test, a computer must demonstrate:\n",
    "\n",
    "## ● Natural Language Processing: To understand and respond in human language.\n",
    "## ● Knowledge Representation: To store and retrieve facts and beliefs.\n",
    "## ● Automated Reasoning: To draw logical conclusions and answer questions.\n",
    "## ● Machine Learning: To adapt and improve with experience.\n",
    " \n",
    "Although the Turing Test has symbolic significance, few researchers focus solely on passing it today.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Beyond the Turing Test — The Total Turing Test\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Total Turing Test extends the original concept by including perceptual and physical tasks:\n",
    "## ● Computer Vision: To visually interpret the world.\n",
    "## ● Robotics: To physically interact with and navigate environments.\n",
    " \n",
    "## ● Turing’s test remains influential not because it defines AI’s endpoint, but because it highlights essential competencies required for general intelligence. Modern researchers, however, prioritize understanding core principles over mimicking humans perfectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Thinking Humanly — The Cognitive Modeling Approach\n",
    "To say a program thinks like a human requires understanding human cognition itself. Cognitive \n",
    "modeling uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "## ● Introspection: Examining one’s own thought processes.\n",
    "## ● Psychological Experiments: Observing human behavior in controlled settings.\n",
    "## ● Neuroimaging: Studying brain activity.\n",
    " \n",
    "By developing computational models that simulate human thought patterns, researchers can test \n",
    "theories about cognition. The interdisciplinary field of cognitive science merges AI and \n",
    "psychology to create testable, mechanistic explanations of mental processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Thinking Rationally — The “Laws of Thought” Approach\n",
    "Dating back to Aristotle, this approach centers on codifying perfect reasoning:\n",
    "## ● Syllogisms: Structured arguments that yield true conclusions from true premises.\n",
    "## ● Logic: A formal language for expressing and manipulating knowledge.\n",
    " \n",
    "## ● 19th-century logicians laid the groundwork for programs that could solve problems expressed in logical form. However, translating human knowledge into formal logic is challenging, and reasoning systems often struggle with computational complexity. These issues gave rise to more flexible AI paradigms that incorporate uncertainty and practical constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Acting Rationally — The Rational Agent Approach\n",
    "The rational agent model defines an AI as an agent that perceives its environment and acts to \n",
    "maximize expected outcomes. It encompasses:\n",
    "\n",
    "## ● Autonomy: Operating independently.\n",
    "## ● Adaptability: Learning and adjusting to new circumstances.\n",
    "## ● Goal-orientation: Pursuing objectives intelligently.\n",
    " \n",
    "## ● Rationality includes logical inference but also reflexes and heuristics that bypass explicit reasoning when necessary. This framework is more general and scientifically tractable than human-centered approaches, making it the dominant paradigm in AI today.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rationality and Real-World Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "## ● While rationality is a compelling ideal, real-world environments are too complex for perfect rationality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ● Computational limitations and incomplete information force systems to adopt bounded rationality—acting effectively under constraints. \n",
    "## ● Modern AI uses the rational agent as a foundation while acknowledging that trade-offs and approximations are inevitable. \n",
    "## ● The journey toward general intelligence involves embracing this complexity while designing agents that make good decisions in practice.\n",
